Longer explorations of statistical/machine learning methods or ideas.

#### [Causal mediation: an overview](/posts/causal-mediation)

A short introduction to causal mediation analysis and the need to think carefully about potential confounding when undertaking such analyses.

#### [ARCH models and Bitcoin volatility](/posts/bitcoin-volatility)

Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models have such a long name they must be great right!? I develop some ARCH models that attempt (badly) to predict Bitcoin / \$US price movements.   

#### [Structural nested mean models](/posts/structural-nested-mean-models)

This is a long post trying to understand structural nested mean models and their role in causal inference. 

#### [Linear regression from a Gaussian process point of view](/posts/gp-linear)

Notes on Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book.

#### [Frontier of simulation-based inference](/posts/simulation-based-inference)

Reading Cranmer, Brehmer & Louppe's overview of simulation based inference.

#### [Automatic differentiation I](/posts/autodiff-forward)

Reading Baydin, Pearlmutter, Radul & Siskind's excellent paper.
