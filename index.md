## Welcome

On this website you'll find some posts and notes written by me, Ois√≠n Fitzgerald. They are generally about statistics, machine learning and causal inference. You can find the source code for the posts and website [here](https://github.com/oizin/oizin.github.io).

## Posts

#### [Causal mediation: an overview](/causal-mediation)

A quick introduction to causal mediation analysis and the need to think carefully about potential confounding when undertaking such analyses.

#### [ARCH models and Bitcoin volatility](/bitcoin-volatility)

Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models have such a long name they must be great right!? I develop some ARCH models that attempt (badly) to predict Bitcoin / \$US price movements.   

#### [Structural nested mean models](/structural-nested-mean-models)

This is a long post trying to understand structural nested mean models and their role in causal inference. 

## About me

I'm currently a PhD candidate at the Centre for Big Data Research in Health at UNSW Sydney. I'm interested in digital health and the role that data and analytics can play in improvement of the healthcare system and patient outcomes.
