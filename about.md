# Welcome

On this website you'll find some posts and notes written by me, Ois√≠n Fitzgerald. They are generally about statistics, machine learning and causal inference. You can find the source code for the posts and website [here](https://github.com/oizin/oizin.github.io).

# About me

I'm currently a PhD candidate at the [Centre for Big Data Research in Health](https://cbdrh.med.unsw.edu.au/) at UNSW Sydney. I'm interested in the role that data and analytics can play in improvement of the healthcare system and patient outcomes.
